{"review": "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \nit's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \ni don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \ndon't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . \none thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . \nhe's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . \n \" it's your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . \nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \nin the movies , you end up with films like \" spawn \" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . \nalmost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \n ( chan's first release in this country , \" rumble in the bronx \" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \nheck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \nin condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , \" jackie , save us ! \" , and misuse firearms . \nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . \nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . \nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . \ndon't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \njust go see the movie . \noperation condor has pretentions of being a \" raiders of the lost ark \" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \nhowever , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \npatrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . \nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \nbut the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . \nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \nwritten and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \nalda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \nshe's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \nand to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . \nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . \nringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \nwalsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . \nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \nit's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \nlapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \nand what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \ni don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . \nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . \nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \nthe film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \nas a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \nand while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it's laughable . \nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "after watching \" rat race \" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . \nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \n \" rat race \" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \nthen comes the setup . \ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , \" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . \" \nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \ndirector jerry zucker ( \" airplane , \" \" ghost \" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ?

{"review": "i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nwhat if he's also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . \ni don't quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \nalthough it wouldn't surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . \nalmost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . \nwe're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n", "sentiment": true}

' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \n", "sentiment": true}

) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . \nnow that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n", "sentiment": true}

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he's done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n \" his future is clouded . \" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original \" a soldier's story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . \nand maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni'm privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \" couldn't care less about the truth \" but was more interested in capturing \" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \" \ndespite violating nearly every rule of \" legitimate \" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \" ) to mary tyler moore ( \" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \" ) to style ( \" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \" ) . \nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \nwhen the designer declares that \" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you \" it's just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n", "sentiment": true}

time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i'm so proud of you , honey . \nyou didn't screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \nmr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \nevery nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it's audience to think and examine . \nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . \nit's a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it's quite fresh and original . \nit's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he's a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn't really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's \" a \" list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . \nlambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . \nthis isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . \nfor daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "`we run tings . \ntings don't run we . ' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . \nkevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe's finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . \ninstead of \" i'm gonna get that kid \" they say \" i'm gonna kill that kid . \" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \ncool . \n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \nthrough coal-mining . \nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . \nanother commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "every year , hollywood crowns a new \" it boy \" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \ninheriting the mantle from last year's \" winner , \" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n", "sentiment": true}

muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ;

{"review": "i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . \nmel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren't , you should still like this film . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children's story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! \" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that'll do , donkey . \nthat'll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \nbut the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it's a small world . \" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ?

{"review": "after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' \" \nof course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \n , \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \ntoo many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \nrealizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . \nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . \nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \nit's very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \n", "sentiment": true}

he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n \" i'll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . \nthere's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time . \nfor over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \ni'm not entirely sure why , exactly . \nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \nthey're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \nat the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but \nafter having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . ) \n \" drunken master \" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \nafter embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \nthen , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \nit's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \nwhether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and \nit's often as funny as anything , too . \nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \nthere's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \nbut they're still hilarious as ever . \nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \ni'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \nit apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . \ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . \ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's \nnot just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn't . \nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \nit's much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \nyou might very well like it . \nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if \nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) . \nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . \nall in all , i give this film an . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \nconsidering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \nterry gilliam's \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \nyes . \ndoes it matter ? \nnot really . \nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn't explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point . \nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn't like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ?

{"review": "blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . \nin case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . \nhis life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . \nthat's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \ntalking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \nhis character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona . \nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . \nhe's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . \ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . \nquiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . \nunfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! \nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia . \nshe plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . \nthe supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy . \nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . \npeter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . \nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . \nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . \nsadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . \nalso , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . \nthe screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . \nwhile christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . \nalso , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . \noverall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . \ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . \nit offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows . \nmost of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made . \ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . \nthey show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . \nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . \nthe group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . \none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . \nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . \nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . \nthe picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . \nwinterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . \nthis portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com \nselection mad city . \nwe watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . \nhowever , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . \nstephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . \nhe portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . \ndillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . \nhenderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . \nit is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . \nwoody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . \nharrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . \nharrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . \nthis ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . \namerica's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . \nfor those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . \nwar is a foreign concept to most of us in america . \nbattles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . \ntelevised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . \nthis picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it's a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . \npaul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . \nharry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . \nwhen jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . \nsoon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . \nthere are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . \njames garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . \nstockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . \nreese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . \ngiancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . \nwith a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . \nluckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . \ntwilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . \nit may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . \nthe major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . \nhowever , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . \nthe supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . \nstockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . \nthere's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . \nit's a minor , but irritating , flaw . \nwith a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . \nit's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . \nat a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . \nstill , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . \nit is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie \" fingers \" coyle ( mitchum ) . \nhe got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . \nhis current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age . \nhe is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . \nhe could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . \nhe is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . \nthe masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . \non one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . \ncoyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . \nhe is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . \nwith the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . \nhe contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . \nthinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . \nbut foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . \nwarning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . \nthe bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . \nthe contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . \ncoyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , \" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . \" \ndillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . \nthis is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . \nthe city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . \nthere is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . \nmitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . \nit makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . \nmitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . \nbut in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . \nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \nfor those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \ndon't miss it . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" crazy/beautiful \" suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome . \nafter a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . \nbut rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown \" afterschool special . \" \neven worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to \" tone things down . \" \nneedless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . \n \" we were trying to make a cautionary tale , \" he told newsweek , \" and we couldn't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . \" \nregardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . \n \" crazy/beautiful \" is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for \" failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . \" \nset in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . \nevery morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . \nan honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . \nall is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . \nnicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction . \ncarlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . \nplus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . \nas with \" save the last dance , \" \" crazy/beautiful \" ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . \nwhile noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . \nthe filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . \ncute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior . \nshe is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . \nas carlos , hernandez is a revelation . \nhunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . \naside from its title , the biggest problem with \" crazy/beautiful \" is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . \nafter carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . \nstill , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . \n \" afterschool special \" my ass ? \" crazy/beautiful \" is the real deal . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with \" progress . \" \ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \" erstwhile fogy \" giles into a three-dimensional human being . \ndespite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . \ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \nwhat he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . \ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \neventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . \nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . \nbut , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . \nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . \nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . \nit's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \nhe is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \" fish out of water \" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he's taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . \nthere's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ?

{"review": "after a stylistic detour with mrs . \nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" the fugitive \" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . \nit takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout . \nthis isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . \nmost of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe're so relieved when justice is served . \nit's not the plot is that makes \" the fugitive \" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . \nwatching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . \nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this . \n ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" nick of time \" ] \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \nbut i don't care . \nnot even a little . \nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \n3 ) the movie is so funny . \nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \ni haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \noh sure , it's trite . \nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . \nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \nhe can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \nas far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \nand the movie is just so funny . \nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . \nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \nin addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \na lot . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \nwhile it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film's bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he's almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! \nthat's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . \nit's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . \ntake argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don't talk about fight club . \" \narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \nresentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \nit's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \ni'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \nthey needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . \ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . \nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it's fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?

\nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i've seen all year . \n", "sentiment": true}

) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . \" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money's worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \ngo see it ! \nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . \n \" hard copy \" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \nsmart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \nsmart's got a point . \nit wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \nhowever , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' \nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \nher husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . \nkidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . \nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers . \nhenry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \nall-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! \nto die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . \nwritten by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . \nrated r - for language and mature themes . \n ( respect the r , not for under 14's ) rating ----- stars . \ngo see it . \n", "sentiment": true}

\" \na guest asks impatiently . \n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele's \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \nit's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \nafter all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this . \nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \nokay , it is a let-down . \ni'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good . \nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \nin the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off . \nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden . \nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \nthat's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don't cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \nmadonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \nat the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \nher death , though , is brilliant . \nher singing could be better though . \ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard . \nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \nbut it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \nlike the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , \" jude the obscure , \" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n \" jude \" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from \" shallow grave \" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of \" jude \" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . \n \" jude \" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . \nthere's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what \" jude \" is . \nsure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- \" titanic \" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see \" titanic , \" branagh's \" hamlet , \" \" sense and sensibility , \" and \" heavenly creatures , \" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . \n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nyup . \ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \nwag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \nok , maybe it's not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \n ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \nand because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map . \nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \ninstead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \nit's all : \" what do i love ? \nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way . \nit's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up . \neven on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \ninsiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't . \nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it . \nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \nafter seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . \nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \ngaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \nwhile besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \nat first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \nthe story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" very bad things , \" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material . \nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed . \nas robert puts it : \" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . \" \nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \n \" okay , there is only one option now . \nyou can forget about calling the police , \" he says . \nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \n \" very bad things , \" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , \" there's something about mary , \" wanted to be . \nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \nthere's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , \" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , \" i couldn't help but crack up at how \" balls-to-the-wall \" this film had become . \njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \nit is at this level that , \" very bad things , \" was so entertaining and surprising . \njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : \" very bad things , \" is not a movie for everyone . \nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and \" safe \" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \nset in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly . \nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer \" continues to have such high expectations of people . \" \nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor . \ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . . \nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \ncalling them \" princes of maine , kings of new england \" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \nregardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \nfiguring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \ngod has also given us a set of rules . \nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \nand yet , many continue to ignore his \" rules \" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \n \" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . \" \nproverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] \njust as a builder follows a designer's blueprint or a conductor follows a composer's score , why shouldn't we follow the rules of life given to us by life's architect for our own blessing ? \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . \nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \nyou honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \nyou'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . \nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \nplaying sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989's \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n", "sentiment": true}

' \nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \nbut i digress . \ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \nthe story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it's over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \nwilliams is the title character , hunter \" patch \" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \nwe're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \nit's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board . \nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity . \nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why . \nmonica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \nfor some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \nthe script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way . \nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \npatch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \nnevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place . \nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . \napparently , it was just lying dormant . \nwith ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . \nford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . \nof course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . \nwhile some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . \nboth actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . \nnaturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . \ngranted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . \nbut the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . \nreitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . \nhis big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . \nas appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . \nholding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . \nshe can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . \nformulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer \" popcorn \" movie season's lack of substance . \nit's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . \npass the popcorn . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe's mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . \nthere's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . \na captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . \nin this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . \nthe first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . \nmichael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . \nafter a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . \nthree of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . \nafter the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . \nthis sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . \nthe wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . \nthe outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . \nthe second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . \nthe men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . \nthis prison , run by the v . c . , \ninitiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . \nsteven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . \nmichael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . \npersonally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . \nthe men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . \nmichael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . \nmichael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . \nhe wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . \nhe assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . \nthe third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . \nonly in this game , you play for money . \nmichael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . \nthe two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . \na very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . \nthe greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . \ndo not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit's also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf -

{"review": "with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don't end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \nand scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \nit's hard to understate this last point . \nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \nand , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . \nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . \nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \nthey're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \nthere's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . \nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \none problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \nthey're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \nit's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \nshe doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . \ngiven this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \nthe film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) \nbut hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : \" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \nlook what that got her . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \nsince then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . \nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \nthe film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . \nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \nwhile it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \nis the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) \nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \nhe easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . \nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death . \nnot only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \nmr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score . \nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \nduring the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \nthere's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \nbut although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n", "sentiment": true}

story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . \nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . \nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company . \njohn c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . \nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . \nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . \nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following . \nas well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . \nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . \nand in actual fact , it does . \nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . \nit is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . \nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds . \nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . \nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . \nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . \nwhen the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . \nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . \nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . \nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . \n ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) \notherwise the event was quite believable . \nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . \nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \n \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" \nhowever a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . \nnote that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , \" \nso the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . \nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . \nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film . \nthe same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \ncontact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \nellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \nit's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \nas if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . \ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \nthe question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \neven when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \ndon't get me wrong . \nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \nit's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . \nthis is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . \nthis italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . \nbut benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . \nthe movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . \nlike many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . \nhe ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . \ninstead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . \nin benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . \nguido wins dora . \nthey marry . \nfast forward about five years . \nguido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . \nguido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . \nbut racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . \nthe task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . \nhere , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . \nit is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . \nfor the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . \ntrue , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . \nunlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . \nhis story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . \nfor guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . \ngiosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . \nthe winner takes home a tank . \ntherefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . \nhe cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . \nguido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . \nguido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . \nthroughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . \nultimately , the allies rescue the camp . \nin a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . \nthe boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . \nthe price for his victory is most high . \nbenigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . \nlife is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . \nit is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . \nthose who object to it are missing its point . \nand that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \nsince 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \nit is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \nfor others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \nat least that's how it is all beginning . \nbut when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \nwhat is thought ? \nwho are we ? \nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . \nwith this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n", "sentiment": true}

' . \nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen . \nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why . \nthere's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \nwe're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands . \none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind . \nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit's one of mrs . \ndoubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit's easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . \nthere's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece \" zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ?

{"review": "i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \nthe story of serendipity is simple . \ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \non the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand . \nbut it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \nin the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \nthere's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . \njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . \nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . \njoe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . \nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \nmark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \nthe script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' \nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . \nreservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . \nhere's what the two movies do have in common . . . \n--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf \nreservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . \ncrime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . \nthe five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . \ninstead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino's chin ) . \nmost of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . \nmr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . \nthe police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . \nthe story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . \neventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . \nlet's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . \na lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . \nthe opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's \" like a virgin . \" \nanother scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . \nneither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . \nreservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . \nall it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . \nand what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? \nand potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . \na computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . \nbut after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it . \ninstead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad . \nwith the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) \ni remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . \nit was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . \nof course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 . \ni wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares . \ni hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon . \nbroderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) . \nbut the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups . \ndavid's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove . \nif for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days . \ndavid uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers . \nthe modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on . \nfar from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum . \nthe big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today . \nwhat are the lessons we can learn from wargames ? \n1 . \nmake sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers . \n2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers ! \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back . \nthe audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . \nin short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year . \n ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . ) \nin one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie . \nit seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent . \njason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it . \njay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen . \namong others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , \" action ! \" \nbest of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies . \nthe film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was \" stupid \" enough to buy tickets to this movie . \n ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . ) \nthe film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet . \nguilty . \nalthough it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them . \nit's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny . \njay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize . \nhis favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything . \nbut it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success . \nhis reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems . \nthe story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) . \nthese charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture . \njay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long . \none of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry . \ngranted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best . \nand , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far . \nno , wait . \nforget , `thus far .

{"review": "this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic . \npostponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . \nso , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? \nmy best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . \nno doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . \nit boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . \nto see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . \nthe effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . \nbut titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies . \nthere is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . \ni'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : \nthe film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . \nwe see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . \nbill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . \nwhat he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . \nwe meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . \nrose is to be wed to a man she does not love . \nwe meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . \nthe two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . \nadd in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . \ni must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with \" new money \" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . \nshe is a pleasure to see on screen . \nwhen the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \nthe film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . \nthe effects are tremendous . \nfrom the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . \nwe saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . \nmy friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . \nwhen people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . \ntitanic runs far too long . \nthe movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . \nand , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . \ndon't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's \nnot a bad as i am making it out to be . \nit really is an exceptionaly well-made film . \nthe costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . \nthe ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . \nthis film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . \ncameron has certainly made his best film to date . \nunfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . \nit just doesn't have a strong supporting story . \nit's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . \nit just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . \ni predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . \nit is a film worth seeing . \ni predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . \nwith its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . \nthis will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . \ntitanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . \ni give titanic 3 stars ( . \nthat's not bad . \nron epstein \nriginally posted in home theater forum === \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "a common complaint amongst film critics is \" why aren't there more literate scripts available ? \" \nquiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . \npaul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . \nthe film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g . \na '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . \ndeft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . \nredford departs from the usually overlight , \" cable tv quality \" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . \nquiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . \nalthough i was only 4 years old when the \" twenty one \" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette . \nfrom plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without \" disposable income , \" before the manifestation of its american dream . \nthe film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from \" the good life , \" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame . \nthough the 50s audience that is \" rocked \" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . \ncharles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . \nthe tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . \nat the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . \nlike the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this \" mirror \" may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days . \nlike the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . \nthe result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message . \nthe message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) . \nbored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate . \nnot part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus . \nyou can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name . \nwhat makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message . \none of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly . \nit'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot . \ndistracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view . \nyou'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens . \nthis film camera is just another one of the guys . \ntiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across . \nbored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares . \ni don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be . \nthat said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted . \nif that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film . \nstay at home and rent up close and personal . \nand what's a buzz without tunes . \nfrom pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film . \ngood and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message . \nevery once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict . \ntrainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations . \ndom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago . \nhe has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago . \nnowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production . \nhe is currently finishing a couple of small projects . \nwith his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "steven spielberg's \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . \nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \nfor one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \n \" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \nspielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room . \nstill , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \nthis summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \nhowever , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . \nshe inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . \nhe has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases . \nhe is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . \nhe is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . \nhe is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . \nhis father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . \nunsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way \" his \" boy has turned out . \nhe is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . \nsoon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . \nbubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . \nthe father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . \nbubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . \nso far , so good . \nthe first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . \nthe movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe . \nit follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . \nit is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . \nhe observes what it might be like . \nthe intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . \nfor thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . \nthen de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . \nour unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . \nhe is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . \n . \n . \nit goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . \nde heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . \nthe scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . \nthe manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . \nalthough de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \ninnocence triumphs . \nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \nit's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "you've got to love disney . \nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . \nkids have to go see the movie . \nthen they have to get the toys . \noh

magic kingdom . \nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \nit's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \nwhat's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \nluckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \nsoon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . \nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \nby leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \ni'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . \nyou have to hear it to understand . \ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \nwhen mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . \neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \ni found the choice of b . d . \nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . \nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \njune foray , who supplies

{"review": "with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible . \none of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's \" mad about you \" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n", "sentiment": true}

engine * * * \na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder . \nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn . \nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \nthat being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \nit , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \nreaders of sam keith's brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland . \n", "sentiment":

{"review": "i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \nhe's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \nhe's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . \nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \non the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \nthere is some character development during the film . \nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . \nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . \nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \noverall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "the \" submarine \" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \nthink about it . . . \nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \nthey aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \nand they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet . \nwhen a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say \" ugh , another submarine movie \" like people tend to say \" ugh , another boxing movie \" . \nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \nmcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence . \nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \nit's tense , exciting and fascinating . \nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder \" ok , now how do they get out of this ? \" . \nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there . \ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \ni mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ? \nbecause of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom ! \nmy other gripe would be during the film's finale . \nthere's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \ni cannot stress this enough . . . \nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you \" that couldn't happen \" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \nit succeeds fantastically . \n[pg-13] \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nduring the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . \noh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . \nit's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . \nthings aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . \nshe's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( \" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn \" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . \nthe loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . \nmeanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . \nonly through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . \nalthough jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . \nwhile he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . \nin terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . \nthe opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . \nthe timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . \nof course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . \ntenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? \nsure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . \nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . \nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . \nthis new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . \nmr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . \nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . \nas it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . \ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! \nand larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) \nof course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . \nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . \nand while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . \nwith an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" last night \" could have an \" aka \" tagged on the end of it that says , \" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine \" . \n \" last night \" is about just that . \nthe last night of planet earth's existence . \nthe world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . \nhow scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . \nnor is the event itself . \nthroughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . \nin doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . \nhe's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . \nthe film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . \nmckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . \nthe film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . \nthere's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . \nher husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . \nfinally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . \nmckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months . \nthese people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . \nwe can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . \nrennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . \nhe exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants . \nbut for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . \ni knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . \nhis insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . \nhe doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . \nhe realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . \nmckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . \nmy only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . \ni really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . \ni appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . \nhowever , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . \nanother problem is we never see anybody panicking . \ni would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . \ninstead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve . \ni just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . \nno one had the urge to \" rage against the dying of the light \" . \ndespite these small problems , \" last night \" is one of the best movies of the year . \nas opposed to the moronic \" armageddon \" , \" last night \" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . \nand bruce willis never shows up to save the day . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" a bug's life \" may not be \" toy story , \" but it's more close than \" antz \" was . \ni really liked \" antz , \" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that . \nmaybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . \n \" a bug's life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . \n \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug's life \" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . \nit broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" \nit's also light and clever . \nthe visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . \nthe characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . \nthe lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . \nand for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . \nnot that the plot's really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it's basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \nthe writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug's life \" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . \nstill , it's no \" toy story . \" \nthat film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \nit proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \nyet \" a bug's life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "when i saw the trailer for \" the sixth sense , \" i didn't expect much from it . \nmy snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of \" the shining \" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . \nbut all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . \nit turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . \nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . \nat the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . \na year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . \ncole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called \" freak \" by the other boys in the neighborhood . \nweird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . \nhe steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . \nthe trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist . \nif it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . \nif you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see \" the sixth sense . \" \nanyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . \nonce malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . \ndead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . \nmalcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . \nthe box office success of \" the sixth sense \" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . \ni hate to burst anybody's bubble , but \" the sixth sense \" isn't really a horror film . \nat its core , \" the sixth sense \" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . \nsome scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . \none that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , \" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun \" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . \nosment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . \nit's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! \nalthough willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . \nif only willis' work were as impressive . \naccustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . \n ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , \" the story of us , \" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . \nwriter/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . \nhe's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates . \nonly when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . \nlook for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . \nbottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \ndid dolores kill her husband ? \nand did she kill her employer ? \ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . \nit's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \nmike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \nhe never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \nit's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \ntechnically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid's \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them . \nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e . \nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals . \none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \nmatt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer . \nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved . \ncan someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \neverything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . \nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": " \" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . \ni really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . \nmy problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . \nin addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . \nthe only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . \nhowever , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . \nneedless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . \ni can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . \ni can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . \nit's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . \nout of sight proves that it doesn't . \ni had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . \nafter seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . \nhere , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . \nhe does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . \nhe goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . \nwe're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . \nfortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . \nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . \nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . \nat first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . \nit's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . \ni've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . \nhe's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . \nhe uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . \nas i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . \nlopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . \ni can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . \nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . \nthe brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . \nthe scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . \nthe supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . \ndennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . \nsteve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . \nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . \nout of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . \noverall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . \nnot every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . \nas for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \namong my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . \n ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) \nwhile i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out ) . \nthe difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis . \nit's also vastly more convincing with its argument . \n \" mathematics is the language of the universe , \" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture . \nsince nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . \nobsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . \nsullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . \nthe story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . \nit helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist . \nall attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries . \nfor a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest . \nstill , we do care about max's fate . \nteetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . \nas we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . \npi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . \nthe repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective . \nin this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction . \nit's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . \n ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) \nusing savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . \npi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . \nthe film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . \nstill , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . \nat one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . . \ncomputer chip . \n \" isn't it beautiful , \" she coos . \na showcase for mr . aronofsky's technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \namos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view . \nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \nthe story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \nhe even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman . \nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \nsince the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \nmeir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \nmeir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \ntheir religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \nso when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \nrivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \nmalka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love . \nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night . \nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \nbut the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and

{"review": "the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \nanderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia's \" scenes drag on too long . \nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring . \nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \nanderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \nanderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife . \nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . \nall recipes are fictions . \ntwentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . \na psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! \ndirector/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . \n \" . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . \" \nthis true story , briefly mentioned in \" the shining \" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . \nin 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west . \nit was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . \ncapt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a \" hero \" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . \nin ways he could never have imagined . \nboyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . \nupon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously \" over-medicated \" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . \ninto this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . \nseeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . \ncolqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself . \nour heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . \nsoon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . \nit involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence . \nhis hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . \nthere can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . \nit's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . \nas professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . \nteen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . \nolder folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . \nbut jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . \nit has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . \nthe two main characters are also the most interesting . \nboyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . \nhis sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . \ncolqhoun is different . \nhe proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . \nhe believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . \nit is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . \nthe atmosphere in \" ravenous \" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . \ncompletely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . \nhere time stands still , and nothing changes . \nthe inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . \nthey are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . \nmen that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . \nthe result is some sort of cabin fever . \ncannibalism is more like a sick game for them . \nsince they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . \nit's like \" who's going to die first ? \" \nthe unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's \" the shining \" . \nit's hard to not get mad here ! \none of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . \nmusic is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . \na strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . \nthe director herself stated that it was \" ok to laugh \" during the picture . \nand i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : \" . . it's \nlonely being a cannibal . \nyou don't get that many friends . . . \" \nor when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying \" eat to live . \ndon't live to eat . \" ) . but \nmostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . \nevery actor does a great job . \nespecially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . \nthis strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' . \nactually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike . \n \" ravenous \" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring . \nhowever these little failures don't diminish the impression . \nthis is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations . \nit is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always . \nit is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since \" the shining \" . \n \" . . i said no food . \ni didn't say there was nothing to eat . . . \" \n- colqhoun , ravenous \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . \nto be specific , let me give you an example . \ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . \non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \nour film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \nthe killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \none particularly striking m . o . \non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \nno points for guessing what they do . \nher workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . \nthere's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \ngabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . \nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . \nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \njones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . \nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \nit's a great performance . \nreb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \nof course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \nit'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \ni think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through . \nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life . \nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before . \ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \ndisney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films . \nbut don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \nin my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \nbut now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \nwho will prevail ? \ntime will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \nthis may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . \nbut due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version . \nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \n \" when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \nthe second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \nvisually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline . \nbut don't be fooled . . . \nlittle kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it . \nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \nvisually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come . \nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity . \nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe . \nit's truly a great example of film making at its finest . \nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \ndo they ? ) . \nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \ndisney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years . \nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \nin fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless . \ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either . \nmany people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman . \nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses . \nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \nmost of it will go over young children's heads . \ndoes that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? \nnot at all . \nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \nthankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects . \nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home . \nhave i confused you enough ?

{"review": "jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \nmaybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films . \nbut it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film . \nit's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . \nfollowing her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \ncynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . \nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , \" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? \nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \nhence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \nat the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \nmaurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \nbut she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . \nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \nthe film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \nhowever , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . \nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "richard linklater's \" slacker , \" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \nask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , \" oh , you know , just hanging out . \" \nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \n . \n . \n . \nit's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in \" scooby-doo . \" \nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \nthe only problem with \" slacker \" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \nthere are only so many times you can hear , \" hey , what's going on ? \" \n \" not much , what are you up to ? \" \n \" nothing really , just hanging around , \" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . \ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \n \" slacker \" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \ni just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nbulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product . \n ( you go , warren ! ) \nwhen they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews . \nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \nhe's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad . \nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \neventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth . \nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \nit's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \njust don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film . \nfilms such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . \nthe advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . \nthe dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut . \nfor years , i have heard of an \" international \" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . \ni even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on . \nbut after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . \nuntil now . \nthe film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . \nhe lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . \none day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . \ntaking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . \nmathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a \" cleaner . \" \nshe then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . \nat this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . \nthe international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed \" too explicit . \" \ni assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . \nthe best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . \nthere's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe . \nwith these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . \nthe most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . \nthe film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . \nmy advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . \ndirector/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \nwords \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . \nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \nit shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \nthe movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \nhis performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate . \nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \nalthough the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . \nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \nirvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . \nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \nthe third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? \" \nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . \nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \nthat the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment . \ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \nwhat is progress ? \nwhat can one expect out of life ? \nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him . \nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

, or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . \nhowever , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . \ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . \none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . \nmaggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . \nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \nthe next scene is brilliant . \nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \nlucas is filled with great performances . \nforget everything you know about corey haim . \nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . \nit deserves more than that , but i don't want to be

{"review": "i know that \" funnest \" isn't a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that's the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster's -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . \ni can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i've seen all year . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": " \" living out loud , \" is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . \njudith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . \nshe is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . \nshe cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . \njudith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . \nboth of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . \n \" living out loud , \" which was written by richard lagravenese ( \" the bridges of madison county \" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . \nthe three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . \none highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . \nsometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . \none sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . \nan older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . \nas the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . \ninstantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . \nholly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . \nhunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's \" the piano , \" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . \nshe finds the right note for each scene and holds it . \nand devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . \nusually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . \ntopping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model . \nanother joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , \" happy \" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . \nthe last shot is an especially powerful image . \nnothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . \nthe relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . \nas we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . \nand as , \" living out loud , \" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) \ndirected by robert altman \nsome time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . \nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \nthe director ? \nfrancis ford coppola . \nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \ndepends on whom you ask . \nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ?

{"review": "while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . \nboth films consist of a predominately male cast . \nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \npaying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . \nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . \nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . \nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \nit doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . \none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \n", "sentiment": true}

\na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \ndoesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \nbut let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . \nalthough it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \ni'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . \ngo see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": " \" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! \" \nokay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \ndisney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \nit's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \nmuch of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his \" father , \" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \nall he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \nlook back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . \ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \none is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \ni'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \njust fill in the blanks ! \ncan you see it ? \n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \nwe've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ?

\n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan's a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn't that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's \" extreme tarzan . \" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . \" \ndistracting to say the least . \ni'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . \nbut unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \nthis time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \n'nuff said . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ;

{"review": "slavery is bad . \nafter hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out . \nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest \" serious \" film . \nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \ntheir masters ? \nthe spanish government ? \nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \nthe us government ? \nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \neven that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \nthe slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg . \nmuch like his \" shindler's list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \nit's not hard to see who the bad guys are . \nwithout that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult . \nhe has to make the story interesting . \nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \nthe film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \nthe former model's first major role is a winner . \nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \nthere are some other great moments . \nespecially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like \" toy story 2 \" does . \nfar too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little . \nis it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?

\nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \nthere are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . \npixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching . \nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel . \nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \nnot this one . \nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug's life \" and the 1997 short \" geri 's game . \" \n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) \nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \nit's rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . \nit's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \nit's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . \nin fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years . \nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \nit's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \nthe film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future . \nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \nwhen annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \nblanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999's \" boys don't cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000's \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000's \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda . \nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody

{"review": "in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \ntaken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \nbut it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \nal pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \nand matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . \nwill is a troubled individual . \nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \nbut he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards . \nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster's choice moment . \" \nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \nthere's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . \nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \narguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \nbut the right stuff film isn't even fiction . \nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \nin one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time . \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \nshepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives . \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction . \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \nin that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language . \nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \nfilm also lacks proper closure . \non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america . \nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \ntime has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes . \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . \ni don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching \" the x-files \" every sunday night . \nit's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . \ni am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . \nand i love gillian anderson . \nthe x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . \nthe film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . \nthis is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . \ni expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met . \nactually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . \nwhen the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . \nthe film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \nbut wait , i'm getting ahead of myself . \nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \nthe alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \nas i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film . \nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises . \nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \nit's original ( though it has many ties to \" the twilight zone \" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress . \nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \nit's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \nit's nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \nactually , it's nice to see a risk at all . \n", "sentiment": true}

paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to . \nonce they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch . \ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \nit feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \nwe see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \nand yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . \nas such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "matthew broderick and high school comedy . \nthe two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . \nnow it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . \nferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . \nit was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . \nbut election is far different . \nthis production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . \njim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . \nhe is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . \nin turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . \njim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , \" super nice \" young girl . \nshe is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . \nso , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . \nthe metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . \nthe father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . \nthe mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . \nand the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . \npaul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . \ntammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . \nfor reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . \nhe claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . \nso paul agrees and the race is on . \nbut then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . \nher campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . \nwell , \" i don't even want to go to college , \" she says . \nin election , there are no \" good guys \" . \nalmost everyone has their own agenda . \nno matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . \ntracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . \nshe is the girl that would be labeled \" most likely to achieve anything she wants \" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . \njim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . \neveryone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters . \nthat is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . \nmatthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role . \nhis character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . \nof the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior . \nbut even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . \nthe hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . \nbroderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . \none such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . \nyou can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . \nand his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . \nthe supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . \nbut that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . \nhowever , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . \nthis is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . \nshe is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . \nif ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . \nbut don't you dare think that election's goals are similar . \nit is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . \nthere certainly is no pile of marshmallows here . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nmaybe that's going a little bit too far . \nas good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh . \nbut . . . \nthe parallels are there . \ngwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor . \ntitanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . \ngwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy . \nthey both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . \nok , maybe that's not enough parallels . \nso titanic's not in gwtw's league . \nno matter . \ntitanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . \nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . \nthe money was obviously well-spent . \nthe costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . \ni especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . \nbut writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects . \ncameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . \nhe succeeds masterfully . \ncameron does two things that work incredibly well . \nfirst , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just \" titanic \" , not \" the titanic \" , mind you ) . \nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . \ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . \nstuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . \nsecondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . \nthe way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . \ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . \nthe supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in . \n ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . ) \nthe love story itself is rather conventional . \ni think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . \nthe performances are the key here . \nzane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . \nhe's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible . \nat the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not \" can i save this little girl ? \" , \nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \ndicaprio is a revelation . \ni hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really . \n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him . \nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \nwinslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \nat first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \nwe know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \nit's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive . \nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \ncameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \ni showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he's quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don't know him \" . \nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \ni'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \nhe's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius . \nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's . \nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit . \nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \nit's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off . \nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery . \nhe's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us . \ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) . \nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ?

? ? cusackian . \ni'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \nwe don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \n . \n . \nwell , it's hard to say . \ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \ni'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . \nhollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . \nand good characters . . . \nand good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . \nand for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . \nthe closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . \nnow comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . \nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . \nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . \nusing this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . \nunfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . \nsince seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . \nlately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . \nmost people don't even realize that it is a film . \ndespite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . \nniccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . \ngattaca begins in the 21st century . \nprocreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . \nnatural child birth is considered old-fashioned . \nwe are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . \none of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . \nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . \nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . \nhowever , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . \nas a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . \nanton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . \nvincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . \nlabeled an \" in-valid , \" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . \ngerman introduces him to a \" valid \" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . \njerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security . \nin exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . \nafter the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . \nirene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed \" valid \" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . \ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . \nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . \nunfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . \nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . \nthe orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . \nthe sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . \nas we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future . \nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . \nthe best thing , however , is the plot . \nthe story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . \nat its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . \nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . \nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? \nmaybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws . \nif we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? \nniccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . \nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . \nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . \nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . \nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and \" valid \" peers . \numa thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . \nher character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn't about her . \nhowever , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . \njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . \nhe provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . \nloren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . \ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . \nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . \nstill , he does a good job . \ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . \ngattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . \ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . \nit turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . \nif this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . \nhowever , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn't talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . \ninstead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . \nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?

{"review": "review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . \nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \nnot that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . \nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . \n ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \nwill patrasche save the day ? \nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \nother critics , however , were not so kind . \nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \nsee it while you can . \nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \n", "sentiment": true}

\nwell , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) . \non the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal \" grudge \" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? \noh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? \nit's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \ncan't be that good ) . \nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \nmake sense ?

\nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \ni think it is , and i'll tell you why . \na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \nsometimes that can be tough . \n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \nmight be used to describe a film . \nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \nbut which is more important ? \nand which is better ? \nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \nevery average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \nand so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question . \njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \ntarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \n ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars . \nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \nordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \ncoming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry . \nmax's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \nalso involved is ordell's \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him . \ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time . \njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable . \nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \njackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \nthis is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel \" rum punch \" . \nfor those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making . \nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all . \nit's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans . \nif you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \n", "sentiment": true}

was released , \" at first sight \" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . \nthe film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . \nat the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . \namy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . \nonce she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . \nat first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . \nultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . \nhe moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . \non the basis of the overall story , \" at first sight \" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , \" awakenings . \" \nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \nhowever , what helps \" at first sight \" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you've got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the \" big city . \" \nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \nval kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's \" mimic , \" 1998's \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \nthe one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \nin \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . \nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . \n", "sentiment":

{"review": "in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . \nit angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . \nit ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . \nhaving endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . \ndoes men live up to its press ? \nwell , yes it does . \nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \nhoward is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \nthe reason ? \nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \n \" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \" he says . \nhoward , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan . \nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \nyou can guess which one she falls for . \nsoon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \nhis evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile . \nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart . \nhis character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \nhe's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe . \nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \ncould it happen in the real world ? \nprobably not . \ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \nmaybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \nthe marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \nby the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . \ndeath -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . \nand , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . \nscream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously . \nthe success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . \nthe unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . \na sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . \nas stipulated by one of the \" rules of sequels \" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . \nparadoxically , there's a lot less gore . \nthere is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . \ncraven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . \na second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . \nafter all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . \nscream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . \nas in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue . \nthis time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the \" true life \" events of scream ) . \nsome of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . \nshortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . \ncraven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the \" movie within a movie \" sequences . \nthey give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . \nstab features heather graham in the \" casey becker \" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as \" sidney prescott \" ( neve campbell ) . \nsadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . \nit would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . \nfollowing the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . \nher friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . \nonce the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . \nat the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . \nshe has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . \nalso arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . \nin addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . \nthere's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . \nultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . \nfrom the stab scenes to lines like \" brothers don't last long in situations like this , \" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . \ntheir resolution to the obligatory \" whodunit ? \" \nis less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . \n ( \" nice twist , \" quips the killer . \n \" didn't see it coming , didya ? \" ) \none senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . \nsupposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \nduring the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \n \" ben-hur . \" \n \" cleopatra . \" \n \" the robe . \" \n \" sparticus . \" \n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \n \" quo vadis . \" \nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . ) \nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds . \nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \nalso , like mel gibson's epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger . \nit's a simple tale of good versus evil . \nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \nthere's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride . \nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil . \ni've been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \nthis role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \nseveral scenes are tinted . \nwe've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \ni don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic . \n ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . \ni know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of \" science fiction , \" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . \n2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . \nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . \nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . \nsomething bad happens to them . \npictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . \napparently everyone in the town is dead . \nthe authorities call a \" wildfire alert , \" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . \ntwo of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . \nsome went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . \nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a \" directive 712 , \" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . \nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . \ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . \nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . \nthey barely call off the bombing in time . \nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . \nthis triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . \nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . \nmuch of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . \nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . \nthe performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . \nto me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . \nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect . \nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . \nit was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it . \nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \njames cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see . \nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \ndon't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \nas a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \n ( title ) . . . \na shot of an alien egg . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nand so on and so on . \nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \nit's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise . \nit's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \nmany people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) . \nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review . \n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach . \nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \nwhy it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \nmany critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing . \nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important . \nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \nwhile cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \nher reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . \nit's quite touching really . \ncharles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . \ncharles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . \nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . \nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . \nalien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . \nalthough it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . \nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . \nwhile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . \nit's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . \nin fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have

{"review": "ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . \nbruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . \nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . \nfollowed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . \nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . \nthe disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . \nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell . \ncampbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . \nsuch informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . \nalso , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . \nfor that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . \nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became \" confused \" and were unable to perform the scene . \ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . \nthe two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . \ndon't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . \nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask \" have anything to say sam ? \" \nto me , that's not a good sign . \nalso , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . \nwell , compared to rob and bruce anyway . \nalso included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's \" gala \" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . \nthis raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . \noverall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre . \nand the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . \nall special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": " \" if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . \" \nstarring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus \nin recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . \nin modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little . \nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \nand there are ways in which it does . \nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen . \npart of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \nthis makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \nshe adeptly blends them all together . \nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . \nthe point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . \na night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \n \" don't stray from the path , \" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . \nstaying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders . \ncarter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . \nthose who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . \nthis fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . \nif straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk . \nwhen you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential . \nand it's certainly more interesting than the disney version . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "contrary to the title , \" the boxer \" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . \nit's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . \nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . \nwe've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . \noh well . \nit's still an excellent irish story . \n \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . \nfirst off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . \nwhile this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's \" shallow grave \" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . \ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . \nand danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in . \nthey don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . \nbut the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . \nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself . \nwe've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . \nthere's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . \nthe boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . \nthere are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like \" raging bull \" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . \nthey're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . \nand i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . \nbut the backbone of the story is the love one . \nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . \ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . \nit made sure that we didn't just care for one of them . \ni'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . \nthe acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . \ni'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good . \nin the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . \nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . \nthe direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . \ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . \nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . \nthough \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . \nsure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better . \nbut it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . \neven if it could have been better , this'll do . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": " \" the end of the affair \" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \nalthough it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \nbased on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \nthere's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy . \nit's all work and no play with him . \nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \nunfortunately the two break up . \nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \nit's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \nwhile this may sound straight forward it's not . \nit's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . \nall this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . \nwith great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . \nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \neven though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \nwhat's so moving about it you ask ? \nthe tragedy of it all . \nit's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \nback to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses . \nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \ni'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par . \nit just never did anything for me , until now . \nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \nthis is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . \nnot for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year . \nand believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water . \nthank god this film got delayed until december . \nit's my christmas present . \ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film . \nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . \nas a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said \" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to . \" \ntruer words are hard to come by . \nof course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . \nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? \nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \nit's obvious he truly loves titanic . \nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \nrose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry . \nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \nit's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \nbut as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \nit's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her . \nrose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \nwe then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . \nsometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . \ni saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . \nsurprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . \nbut by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . \ntime alone will make that call . \nbut by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side . \nwe were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . \nthat we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . \nthe truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . \nunless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . \ncarrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town . \ntruman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . \nthere is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . \nbut then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . \nthis curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program . \nwhat makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . \nthe soundstage , we're told , is \" only the second man-made structure visible from space . \" \ntruman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . \nweir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky . \nthe second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . \nhis best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . \nhis wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . \nhe sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . \none wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : \" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . \" \nnevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . \nthis convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . \nby underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . \nthere is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , \" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . \" \nbut that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . \nthe abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side . \nthe truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? \nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \nwhat does god really think of us ? \ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be . \nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) \nmamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . \noshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . \none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . \nin its many incarnations--graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . \nset in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . \nas a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . \nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . \nwith the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . \nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . \nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . \nsometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . \nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . \nthe story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . \nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . \nhowever , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . \nshinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . \nthis hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . \nsince that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . \n ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) \nit's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it . \nas was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . \n_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . \nit is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . \nthere are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . \nthis movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . \npatlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . \nthe film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? \nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? \nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting . \nas far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . \nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . \nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . \nas far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . \ni don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . \nthe cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . \nthe audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . \neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . \ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming . \nthe sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . \nas far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ . \nlarge enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . \nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . \nalthough it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment . \nmy . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \nalthough qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \nthere's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \nholmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . \nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . \nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . \nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . \nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nerm , go to go , i guess . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . \nthis film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . \nhowever , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . \nthese sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . \nas in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . \nthe opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved . \nfrom there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . \napparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . \nprivate joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . \nhartman . \nthe film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on . \nthe entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt . \nhartman , continues on . \nprivate pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . \nhe continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop . \nthat is , until sgt . \nhartman comes up with a new plan . \nhe will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . \npyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst . \npyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . \nafter graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service . \nhe is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . \nwhen he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start . \njoker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way . \nhe also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die . \nagain , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . \na few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . \nfull metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past . \nthis film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others . \nthat , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion . \none thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . \nunfortunately , many did . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . \nhe rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . \nburton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . \nwriter andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . \nas `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' . \nlandau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . \nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . \nlandlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . \ncrane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . \nfirst and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film . \nas with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . \nthe horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . \nbut why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? \nalthough enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . \nit was the light comic touch that burton applied . \nthe film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . \nthis is certainly not the only alteration that's been made . \nas the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . \nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . \nit's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . \nstill , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention . \nthe costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . \nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . \na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . \nwalken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . \ni suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . \nall of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . \n`sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . \nif you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . \nin all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . \nas if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . \nevery major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . \nto begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . \nthese two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . \ntravolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . \nif these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . \nthese are just the major characters . \nsmaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . \nthe film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . \nthe film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . \nthe two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . \nafter this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . \nutilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . \nthe two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . \nafter basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . \nthis is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \n \" hand cannon \" , shooting at the two gangsters . \nhe somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . \nthis is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . \nthe film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . \nbutch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . \nvincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . \nvincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . \nafter their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . \neach story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . \neventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . \npulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . \nalong with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . \nand with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . \nsurely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit's good some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price . \nas the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking . \njason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e . \nthe fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion . \nthis stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) . \nhe funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross . \nrosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross . \nherman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this . \nbut eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love . \nthe academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) . \nit maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub . \nthe entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic . \nthe cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well . \ni hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers . \nwilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis . \nwhat were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? \nhow much did he know about crimes against humanity ? \nthe us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation . \n , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nin my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists . \nszabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope . \nit is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them . \nronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich . \nmaj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor . \nwhen other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen . \nafter the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes . \nhe secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty . \nfrom there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra . \nas he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation . \nthere is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting . \nperhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed . \nif so , perhaps he can never come to the truth . \nin large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . \nwhere the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . \nit has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act . \nwhen it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . \nperhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . \nwe are given clues to something but they are never tied up . \nin the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . \nthe film is basically a stage play . \nthe visual is not very important . \ncorners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . \nas with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing . \ni rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n[there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . \nat one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say \" jan 16 tues . \" \na quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 . \nthe events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 . \na possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ] \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": " \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie . \nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal . \neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill . \nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it's his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \nin \" gattaca \" 's series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view . \nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it's a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \nalthough it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \n", "sentiment": true}

ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \nthis description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \nlynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \nthe main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \nlynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \nit's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \nthat said , these minor flaws don't prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "i'm not really sure what to think about \" crash . \" \non the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork . \ni mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out . \nbut then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained . \n \" crash \" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue . \nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization . \nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed . \nbut what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience . \nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of \" henry and june \" or the just plain horniness of , say , \" deep throat \" ( not that i've seen it ) . \nif one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole \" auto eroticism \" thing . \nthe film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge . \nthe film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of \" the game \" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar . \nsuddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) . \nthe next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie . \nthe next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades . \nwhile the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge . \nsoon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on . \njames is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive . \nthe two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . \nwhen james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . \nyou wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . \nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . \nin one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . \nsoon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . \nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge . \ni'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex . \nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . \nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . \nthen when it happens , we hold our breath . \nthe same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . \nthese people are merely taking it to another level . \nthe only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant . \na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . \nthis goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . \nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . \nthere's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize . \nbut still , they coulda cut it down a bit . \nbut the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . \nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . \nand there are several scenes are just amazing . \none scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . \na sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . \nand the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded . \nthe acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . \nwhile james spader is pretty boring ( he's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . \nshe speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she's enjoying it or not . \nin one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . \nholly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . \nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . \nhe often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . \nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he's getting a freaky tatoo . \nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . \nkosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in \" teenage mutant ninja turtles \" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he's capable of bigger roles . \nwhile i hardly enjoyed \" crash , \" it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . \nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . \ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there's also an r-rated version , but i wouldn't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \nhowever zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \narlo is not happy with his job . \nhe is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \nand they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her . \nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \ngregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior . \nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \nhowever , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \nthat's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film . \nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own . \nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine . \nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own . \nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \nzero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria's character . \nshe's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment . \nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \nbill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \nthere's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called \" zero \" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \nyou don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \ni'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography . \nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \nchan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \nthe combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \nlone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \ndirector ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \ni'm surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \ni give it a b . \n", "sentiment": true}
{"review": "shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . \nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? \nif this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . \nif , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . \nnamely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . \nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands . \nhamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and \nthe game is afoot . . . . \nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . \nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . \ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . \nthe hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . \ncostuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . \nnot quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . \nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . \nin addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . \nas the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . \nfrom the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . \nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript . \nhamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . \njulie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . \nkate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . \nrichard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . \nnicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . \nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . \nin some cases , this made for interesting scenes . \nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . \ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . \nhowever , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . \nas the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . \npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . \nhis off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . \ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . \nunfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . \njack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare . \nas marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . \ngerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . \nrichard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . \ni think he had two lines . \nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . \nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . \nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . \nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . \nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . \nthis only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . \nyou don't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . \nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . \nin it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king's english . \nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes . \n", "sentiment": true}

{"review": "synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight . \nthat's how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn't i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n", "sentiment": false}

\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier \" carlito's way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . \nnow there's a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it's only when things are over that they make sense . \" \nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \nbut don't fret , it will surface again . \nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \nbut you hold hope for some time . \nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \nit's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? \nto godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \nwhile i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . \nthe days of breathless are no more . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \nthe guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \nit's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's \" style \" , not the director's that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \nand his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n \" how did you know that ? \" \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company's current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "a follow-up to disney's live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that's better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996's \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . \nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in \" men of honor . \" \njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \nfrance's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \nthat done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . \nthere's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \nit's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \n", "sentiment": false}

fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though

internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and

{"review": "all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it's all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn't any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? \" \ni'm wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \nit's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . \ni just didn't . \nsurely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat's it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere's not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . \nit's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n \" detroit rock city \" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . \nit's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \nand what about that script ? \nit's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . \nif it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ?

{"review": " \" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . \" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit's very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \" \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . \ni just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

{"review": "warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \nbut it doesn't really make much of a difference . \ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \nremember when dante's peak came out in february ? \na few months later , volcano was released . \nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \nwell , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . \nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \nto be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \ndeep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . \nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \nit's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . \ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring . \nof course , leder isn't all to blame for it . \nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \nthat's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable . \nwhat isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \ngive me a break , will ya ? \nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \njust when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors . \nleder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . \nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \nleder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . \nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \non another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional . \nit's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn't work for me . \nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \nher character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her . \nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's \" star trek : the next generation . \" \nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \nit's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . \ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \nwell , it's not . \nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . \nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . \nour show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? \nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \nwhen the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . \nhere's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \nwhat reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \nmaybe it will work for some people . \nit didn't work for me . \nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \nhe's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size . \nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago . \nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \nsam is broke . \nmax is dying . \npass the kleenex . \nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well . \nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \nsam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . \nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \nit's icky . \nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \ninstead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nso these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? \nwere they living there before krypton exploded ? \nhow do you get to \" inner space \" ? \nthis whole \" inner space \" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . \nhow do they know where superman went ? \nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? \nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . \nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . \none day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . \nkara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of \" whatever \" that protects the city . \nin the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . \nin three days time , or something . \nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . \nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . \nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . \nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . \nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . \nok . . . \nhuh ? \nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? \nattention movie : explain yourself ! \ni'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . \ni can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . \nknowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically \" wills \" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . \nshe's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? \nlois lane's sister , lucy . \nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now . \nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \nat this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense . \nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an \" evil \" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its \" prey \" is very well done . \nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some \" menacing \" bumper cars ) . \nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \nit's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \ninstead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be \" graceful \" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \nfinally , just one word : monsters . \nfaye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \nat one point ) . \ndunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . \nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \nbelievability aside though , it's still annoying . \nnow despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \nyet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \nyou'd think you were watching a new release . \nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . \nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . \nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . \nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . \nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \ngreat detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \nfor the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . \nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . \nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \ndisc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care . \none question though . . . \nshouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? \ni'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \ni knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \nugh , i give up . \ni'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \n[pg] \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . \npatrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \nand she's not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he's going to rape her . \" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he's in aisle 1 ! \" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she's so empowered . \" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \nit's director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \ntherefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . \nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments . \nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \nthis is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work . \nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \nwhile there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \nit's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled . \neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \nor how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \nas it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression . \nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \nat that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . \nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . \nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \nthis was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \nis he ? \nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \nsoon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \nit doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . \nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? \nor is it a combination of both ? \n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \nthe supporting characters are worse . \nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \nwhat is poitier doing here ? \nhe's one of the best living actors ! \ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \ndiane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \nit's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . \nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \nthere are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \ntake a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \ndoesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?

{"review": "what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nthe big-budget , mega-hype \" event \" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \ngluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \n \" lost in space \" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \nit's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \naudiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has \" star wars \" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens . \nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are \" resolved \" at the right moments . \nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable . \nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \nwe're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \nit's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as \" alien \" -lite . \nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \nbut there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring . \nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \n \" lost in space \" is major film production at its worst . \nit's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . \nsuch is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . \nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . \nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . \nthe killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face . \ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . \nanyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . \nit's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . \nunfortunately , the film never takes off from there . \nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . \nlike most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . \ni've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . \nafter the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . \nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . \ni guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . \nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . \nthe slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . \nfalse scares should always be used in moderation . \nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be . \nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening . \nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? \nthis movie still adheres to them . \ntons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . \nand i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . \nthat type of illogical can be fun . \nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . \nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming . \nactually , you won't be screaming at all . \nat its best , the acting can barely be called \" adequate \" and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two . \nthe film still manages to have some strong points . \nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . \nthere are some intentionally funny moments . \n ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) \nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint . \nbesides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . \nif there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \ni love ralph fiennes . \ni love uma thurman . \ni love sean connery . \nhell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \nthe film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . \nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \ni would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \nthat's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \nit's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \nthis is just plain depressing . \nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . \ni wasn't alive then . \ni don't even watch television now . \ni'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \ni didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \nthey are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \n . \n . \nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . \nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \nnow , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \nthey're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \nthe special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . \nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . \nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . \nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \nthe scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \nthey aren't . \nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \nthey aren't , either . \nand what about this wasted cast ? \noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \nwe're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \ni love the guy . \ni've loved all his films , until this one . \nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . \nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here . \n ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \nwho is to blame ? \nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \nis it the actors ? \nfor god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . \nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \nif the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . \nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \ni also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . \nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here . \ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \nor a sense of purpose . \nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nright ! \nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . \nmaybe some stunts . \nfor all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \ngeorge is in between them . \nhe's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . \nbut i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? \narnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . \nwhen he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . \nwow . \nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . \nit's like she's almost parodying herself in \" pulp fiction \" at points . \nshe's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . \nas for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in \" batman forever , \" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in \" scent of a woman \" or just plain cool parts in \" fried green tomotoes . \" \nalicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film . \nshe can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in \" clueless , \" but her lines kinda sound weird . \nand it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . \nbut in all fairness , she has virtually no part . \njoel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although \ni know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . \nand poor elle . \npoor , poor elle . \ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw \" sirens \" ) . \nbut she has no part ! ! ! \nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . \nthere are no \" couch \" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . \nnow listen to me on this one - in every \" batman \" flick , there's a couch scene . \nin the original , it was with vicki . \nin \" returns , \" it was a good make-out scene with selena . \nand in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . \nthis one , it's nothing . \nand batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly \" part of the family . \" \nfortunately , we get a lot of alfred . \nhe's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . \nhe's a god . \nhe's a father figure . \nhe's also dying . \nthis got to me . \ni love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . \nwe also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but \nthis is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . \nbut in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . \nfor one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . \nand there are some nice touches . \nwhen they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . \ni laughed . \nand during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as \" droogs \" from \" a clockwork orange . \" \ni laughed at all these . \nthe film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or \ndid it just feel like that ? \nthe film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . \npeople are fed up with stupid films . \nthat's why the word of mouth killed \" the lost world ! \" \nthat's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . \nthat's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . \nthat's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's \" face/off \" and barry sonnenfeld's \" men in black , \" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . \ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . \ni like some of his films ( \" flatliners , \" \" a time to kill \" ) but a lot of them suck . \nhe's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . \nbut his costuming for woody allen's \" sleeper \" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . \ni love the \" batman \" series . \nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one . \nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . \nhopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . \nand maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . \nand michael keaton . \nbut we can only hope . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \ni suppose i'm not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works . \nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \nthe film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter's twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \nthey get on . \nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \nand it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn . \ni almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo 'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \nor peter o'toole in \" caligula . \" \ngreat actor , horrific performance . \nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \nand if you don't believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \nbut all of this doesn't matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . \nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \nand my god , it's a long damn sit . \nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made . \nwe already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\u0012s movies or novels , you must \u0013suspend disbelief . \u0014 \nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \neven if you can ignore these somewhat \u0013white\u0014 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\u0012s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\u0012t gel . \nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\u0012t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \u0013goodies versus baddies , \u0014 there are numerous twists in it\u0012s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\u0012s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \nhard rain\u0012s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\u0012s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\u0012t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\u0012t handle anything else . \ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\u0012t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \nif you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \nthe problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \ni'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \nwell , you'd be wrong . \nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \ni'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \nwe know jon , it's called editing . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that's the problem . \nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \nit's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \nit wasn't always this way . \ntim burton's \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . \nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . \nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . \n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . \nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \n \" batman and robin \" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \nit's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \neasily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . \nthe film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . \nas for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . \ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \nthurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \ni don't think so . \nmy prescription ? \nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . \ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . \ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . \nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \nsomething else is what he did . \nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \nshe does not know who the woman is . \nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \nhe just chooses not to . \nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \ni have rated this film fairly low . \nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \nthat's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn't too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' \" \nthen there's the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who's the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it's the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . \nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death . \nsecond , the sex is just bad . \ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing . \nthe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . \ncultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic . \nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's \" dawson's creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \nthere's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either . \neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . \nthis is certainly missable . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \noffender . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \nand it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights . \nthey are so wrong . \nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \nbased on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business . \n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \ni don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \n54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \nit's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses . \nit's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \nwhy his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status ) . \nthere isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \nthere's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \nthen , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! \nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) . \ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \nthis one doesn't . \nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights . \nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \nhe's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \nby the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script . \nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \ni've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \nfrankly , i don't care . \nit's easy to recreate something technical like this . \na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \naside from myers' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \nit's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me . \nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \nit doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \nso , don't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \neverything else i said was just padding . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film . \nthat makes it a film without much center . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels . \nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms . \nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best . \nwhen the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful . \nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \nand the language they talk is earth- english . \napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn't like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement . \nthese visuals work nicely . \nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \napes spring incredible distances . \nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \nbut he delivers them very well . \nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus . \nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \ndanny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \nthat score and the whole film will be remembered

{"review": "jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong . \nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \nhush is one such example . \nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war . \nhush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks . \nfrankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \nhere , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \nof course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \nmaybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . \nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \nhow do we know she's evil ? \nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \nthe evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \nthat's about it for character development . \nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \ni can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good . \nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \nin general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \nthat's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \nthe answer is just about everything . \nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \nhe's too much of a joker . \ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \nmy objections to swordfish are many . \nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \nand that is not enough . \nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \ndustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \nthen there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) . \nif that's the case , forgiveness is granted . \ni'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland . \nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper . \nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block . \nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author . \nironically , that couldn't be truer here . \nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits . \nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres . \njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting . ) . \nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn't necessarily quality . \nand this certainly isn't quality . \nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . \nwatching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . \nwhen the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . \nthis is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . \ngood surprises make movies fun to watch . \nthen there are the bad twists . \nyou either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . \nscrewed perfectly suits the latter description . \nwhat starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . \nby the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . \nlarry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . \nwhoops . \nscrewed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . \nnorm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . \nwhen he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . \ntoo excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . \nnow crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . \nof course , everything that could go wrong does . \nthe first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . \nbut the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . \nthe more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . \nat one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : \" no , you idiot ! \" \ni'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film . \na monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . \nthey give real cops bad names . \nalso poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . \nlooking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . \nhe just didn't belong in this movie . \nmacdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . \nif you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . \notherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \nand in the end , he failed . \nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \nwigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \nin spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \nand so the game begins . \nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control . \nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "sentiment": false}

lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . \npen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's \" all about my mother , \" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . \nthe best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . \nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . \nthe story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook . \nto cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . \nshe is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love . \nin other words , she has to be in control of things . \nin her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ?

\nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \n \" maybe it won't be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \n \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \nit's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs . \nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books . \nthe idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \nsilly but kind of neat too . \ni'm sorry . \ni don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \ni suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself . \nthis turkey is really cheesy . \nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \nthe cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \nand the creature ! \nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay . \nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat's another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \nfinally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" \nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \nit also has violence , obviously . \ni wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz's book . \ntrust me , it'll be time much , much better spent . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the \" odd couple ii \" sneak preview . \nthey were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered . \n \" what a great movie , \" exclaimed one gent at the urinal , \" everything was so true ! \" \n \" yeah , \" laughed a man standing next to him , \" i drive as slow as that one guy did . \nmy kids give me holy hell for it ! \" \n \" and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , \" chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife . \nif you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , \" neil simon's the odd couple ii \" may be just the film for you . \nothers will likely be less charitable . \nwhile \" the odd couple ii \" is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt . \nsimon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri . \nthe contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years . \nthe former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport . \nthey take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of \" wacky \" adventures on the road . \njack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob . \nwhile there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : \" grumpy old men , \" \" grumpier old men \" and \" out to sea . \" \nstill , the two veteran actors are fun to watch . \nmatthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons . \nlemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of \" phnah ! \nphnah ! \" \ndespite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together . \nunfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom . \none contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club . \nif someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . \nburger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot . \nbetween script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs . \ni did , however , keep track of some of the swearing . \ni came up with four \" god-damns , \" three \" shitheads \" and two \" fucks . \" \nthe inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word . \nit's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise . \none running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held . \nat one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word \" san . \" \nthe sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing . \none of the oldest maxims of film-going is \" beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . \" \n \" neil simon's the odd couple ii \" is no exception to the rule . \nwhile the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . \nof course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my \" young-whippersnapper \" ass to boot . \none thing's for sure , though . \nthey'll never catch me in a car chase . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": " \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \nthat's right . \nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \nit's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . \nunlike dustin hoffman's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio's in \" what's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \nhell , he doesn't even have to be shy . \nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm . \nwillis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \nof course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . \nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn't rise to the challenge . \nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . \ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \nmaybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "i have never been a \" star trek \" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . \ni do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , \" star trek : insurrection , \" is no exception . \ndropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , \" first contact , \" \" insurrection , \" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . \nat the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out . \nalso attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . \nafter returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . \nso several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . \n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . \nin , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . \nthe film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . \nmeanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . \nthis plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . \nare filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? \nanother element of , \" star trek , \" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . \nalthough donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , \" first contact . \" \nshe should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . \n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is perhaps the weakest film in the \" star trek , \" series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , \" star trek v : the final frontier . \" \n \" insurrection , \" is the type of \" safe \" sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . \non second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . \nthat way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell . \ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \nhence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \ntime passes . \nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \nthis character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil . \nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \njohn leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point . \nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \nand then there's martin sheen . \nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \ni'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape . \nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal . \nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \nnone of this is present in spawn . \nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's . \nas an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to

{"review": "i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \nwish me luck . \nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . \nfrom what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \nlast year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \nwhatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \nunfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \nit's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \nthere's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \nand , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \nthey're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \nand so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \ngod help us . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . \nwith teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . \nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . \nthe components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . \nbut where are the thrills ? \nthe laughs ? \nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . \nand what a shame that is . \ni loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . \nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . \nteaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . \nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . \ni still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . \nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . \nmrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . \nthe principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . \ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . \nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \nthe plot is a big problem here . \nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \nin the morning . . . \nhow convenient ! \nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \na moment like that never arises . \nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \nit's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past . \nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk . \nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \nit starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten . \nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \ntopol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \ni felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \nunless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \nthe thrills all came from the plot . \nronin is like a film made by another man . \nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . \nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \nthe story is not very easy to follow . \nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \none wonders what they saw in the script . \nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions . \nthat is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright . \nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \nnow don't think i condone this just because i'm male . \nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \ndarnell doesn't think like this . \nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \nafter all , it is largely darnell's fault . \nif he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \nbut he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \nyou especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \n ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \nbut when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \nlook at this movie . \nfour writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary . \nthere are some bright spots , though . \nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right \" . \na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . \nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh \" . \nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \nit seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \nthese flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \nit's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \nit's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \nthe film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) . \ni won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \nsad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \nnow that would be scary . \nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with . \nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered . \n", "sentiment": false}

\ni could just say it over and over again . \nsebastian valmont . \nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . \nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . \nthe ones who do are irritating . \nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \nbut it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \nbut -- dear god ! \n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \nbut i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \nand there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . \nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \nthe film fails in every other way , too . \nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . \ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \nso , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ?

' \nin this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . \nthe film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . \ndr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . \nthe bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . \n'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . \nthe spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's \nhumans . \nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs . \nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . \nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . \nif it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . \nthe director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . \nthere are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . \nif the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . \nin fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . \nthere is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . \nthe camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . \nthe peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . \nsorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . \nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . \ntheir reasonable good fun , however . \nmimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . \nlike dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . \nit may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . \nbut looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . \na good opportunity , then , wasted . \na shame . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? \nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . \ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . \nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . \nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . \nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . \nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . \ni suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me . \non the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . \nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . \nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . \nin fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . \nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? \nprobably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . \nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . \nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . \ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . \nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . \naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board . \nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . \nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) . \nwilliams , once a \" can't miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . \nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . \ngiven her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . \nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . \nmeanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . \nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . \nthis is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . \nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . \nnow , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . \nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . \nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . \neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind . \nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . \nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' . \nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \nthe director is paul verhoven . \nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \nthe problem is to keep us there . \ni can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" god \" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \nthe first two faces are completed . \nnow , it is time for \" the next logical step \" -- human . \ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \nbut that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \nthough it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely . \nthis is a very silly production . \nlaughable , actually . \napparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far . \nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected . \nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there . \nhe becomes a rapist . \nand then , of course , a murderer . \nyou'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \nshue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \nbeing probably the best technical achievement since \" jurassic park \" , they are absolutely amazing . \nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \nit's not better or worse than verhoven's average film . \nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot's of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you'll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" \nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \nand all we can ask is why ? \nthe answer is simple . \nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \nit's all flesh and bones , but no soul . \na void where its imagination should be . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama \" schindler's list \" and directed 1993's intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \nwhat doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water . \nsuddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \nwatching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \nyou've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \naside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \ni could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ? \nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way . \ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does . \nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ? \nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention . \ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \nmcfarlane's \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \nwhat happened ? \nwhy is spawn so bad ? \ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \ni don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \nspawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \nmcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero . \na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \nmore time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \nsheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \nto be fair , however , marilyn manson's \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's \" ( can't you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \nred's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams . \nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight . \nfreddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \nit does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . \nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \nvincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \ni don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . \nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . \nafter a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . \ncomments : \" alan smithee \" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled \" fatal bore \" or \" fatal crap \" . \nif you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by \" alan smithee , \" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . \n \" alan smithee \" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . \nfrankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the \" alan smithee \" moniker for this film . \nwhere to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? \nlet's start with the acting . \nit's pretty bad . \namanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material . \nshe's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . \nher scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . \nthe two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand . \nchristopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . \ntrying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . \nif disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here . \nearly on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . \noutside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . \nthey constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . \nfatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . \nthe script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . \nthis suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . \neven for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . \nso , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . \nthe video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an \" erotic thriller \" . \na thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic . \ni can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something \" erotic , \" that he'd be happy after watching this fluff . \na few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) . \non a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . \nit's no wonder why she hated high school so much . \nas an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration . \ni guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . \nfatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . \nif you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \nthis is a definite plus . \nhere's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people . \nbut this film doesn't let that happen . \nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \nhe's dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \nthe film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \nit's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \nthe studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn't particularly want to stay . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . \nwhere the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . \nwhere the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . \nin short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . \nthe film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . \nsoon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . \nshe jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . \nserafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . \nhowever , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't . \nshe's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . \nactress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . \nshe imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate . \nthis isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . \ndelpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . \ndelpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise . \nshe was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . \ngiven the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . \nit could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . \nand if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . \nthe rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . \ntom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie . \nit would be kind to call him bland . \nactors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive . \njulie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . \nand respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal . \non the technical side , it's all bad news . \nthe computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal . \nthe creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . \nrepeated use is made of the \" werewolf cam \" , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious . \nand the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to . \ndirector anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel . \nas a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . \n ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a \" bad movie \" sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction . \nultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nwhat was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it . \nhe clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show . \nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \nit's the best work she's ever done . \nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \nthat's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \nbetty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film . \nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think . \nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn't even seem aware of this . \nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \n", "sentiment": false}

films would rather choose not to have . \nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \nbut who cares ? \nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \npaul haynes \" > \n", "sentiment":

{"review": "dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . \nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \nhere's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \ndon't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . \nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . \ni don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \ni don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . \nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \nbut what a strange mess it is . \nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \ncan this be the same man ? \ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \nwhy ? \nwho knows . \nwhat are the implications of this ? \ni have no idea . \nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . \nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . \nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? \ni hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . \nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . \nif it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . \nbut it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . \nit's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . \na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . \ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . \noh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . \nit's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \n", "sentiment": false}

\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . \nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? \ncan't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? \nthe whole film is like that . \nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time . \nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there's mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that's mars ? \" \nastronaut a : \" yeah , that's mars all right . \" \nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \nthat exchange isn't actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were . \nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell . \nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over . \nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i'm just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \nsupposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \nme , i alternated between the two . \nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "underwater science fiction stays submerged \nsphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . \nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . \npsychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . \nwhen he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . \nhaving written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . \nhis group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . \nunfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . \n \" after all , \" he explains , \" who reads government documents ? \" \nlead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . \nonce there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo . \ndiscovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . \nwhen adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . \na storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . \n \" my name is jerry . \ni am happy \" flashes across the screen . \nthis is unsettling for the psychologist . \n \" what happens if jerry gets mad ? \" he asks . \nbarnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . \nthen the situation turns bad . \ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere . \na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . \nlethal sea snakes attack goodman . \na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" . \nthe suspicious scientists turn against each other . \nthis has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film . \nhowever even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product . \ndirector barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . \nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . \nit's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . \nit doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin . \nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . \noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . \nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . \ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . \neven goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . \nher psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . \nthere's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . \nwhen an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen . \nthe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . \nchapter headings that divide the movie have no function . \nthe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . \nmuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . \nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't . \neven a science fiction film must be internally consistent . \nthere's too much here that doesn't make sense . \nare the manifestations real ? \nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . \na scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it's not . \nnot everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . \nwhere the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . \neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . \nthe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . \nafter pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . \nit's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . \nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . \nthe weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn't have been much left . \nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there's nothing special on the screen . \nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . \nstealing from \" alien \" , \" the abyss \" and the disastrous \" event horizon \" , this film has learned nothing from them . \nremarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is \" wag the dog \" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . \nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word . \n", "sentiment": false}
{"review": "renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \nwriter steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \nit's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \nwhile all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) . \na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \nand \" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! \" \nstanding out among my favorites . \nbut it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs . \nvan damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \nearly scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \neven typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \npaul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . \nin rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . \ntsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . \nhere , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . \nfor each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . \nthis is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \nfor instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \nas he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . \nit's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \nthe test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \ntsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \nthere isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) . \nif tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . \nbefore it's too late . \nif he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . \nthat is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble . \njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it . \nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto . \nliberation ! he thinks . \nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \nthat's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \nit's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by . \njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \nrobin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love . \nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \njakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . \nit's not a comedy . \nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \nis it a melodrama ? \na war movie ? \na character study ? \nno , no , and no . \njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \n", "sentiment": false}

{"review": "it should have been a classic . \na great cast of respected supporting actors . \nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \nhowever , \" mystery men \" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \n \" mystery men \" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low . \nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \nanother major problem with \" mystery men \" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of \" american pie \" and \" there's something about mary . \" \n \" mystery men \" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . \nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . \nso why continue to watch ? \nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . \n \" mystery men \" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says \" i knew you could do it ! \" \n \" mystery men \" fails in every category it attempts to pass . \nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . \nterrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . \n \" i'm unpredictable ! \" \nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out . \nno ben , you're the complete opposite . \n", "sentiment": false}
